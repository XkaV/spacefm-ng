DESCRIPTION
    SpaceFM-NG is a multi-panel tabbed file and desktop manager for Linux with
    built-in VFS, udev- or HAL-based device manager, customisable menu system,
    and bash integration. SpaceFM-NG aims to provide a stable, capable file
    manager with significant customisation capabilities.
    
    This is a derivative work from http://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/.
    Due to low maintainer activity, this fork was created in order to keep Spacefm development going.

    Most of the information that was in the README has been moved to:
    https://github.com/Teklad/spacefm-ng/wiki
